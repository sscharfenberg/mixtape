/******************************************************************************
 * test badges
 *
 * Turns each suite's JUnit XML into a shields.io ENDPOINT document, so the README can show
 * how many tests a suite holds and whether they passed.
 *
 * WHY A GENERATED NUMBER RATHER THAN A WRITTEN ONE. A count typed into a README is wrong by
 * the next commit, which is why nothing else in this project states one. A badge is the same
 * fact with the staleness removed: CI rewrites it on every run, so it is either current or
 * visibly `unknown`.
 *
 * WHY JUNIT AND NOT EACH RUNNER'S OWN JSON. Vitest and Playwright both emit rich JSON, and
 * PHPUnit emits none — `--log-junit` is the only machine-readable output the three have in
 * common, so one parser serves all three instead of three shapes to keep in step.
 *
 * A MISSING FILE IS `unknown`, NOT A FAILURE. If a job dies before its tests run there is no
 * XML, and the honest badge says so; leaving the previous run's green in place would be the
 * one outcome worse than either colour.
 *
 * NODE BUILT-INS ONLY, WHICH IS WHY THERE IS NO `chalk` HERE as the sibling scripts have. This
 * one runs in a job that has installed nothing — its whole purpose is to read three XML files
 * a previous job uploaded — and an `npm ci` to colour four lines of output would cost more
 * than the job itself.
